# ConcurrentJustice
A small example of a possible just program.

---

In this program a data center is shared between 5 threads, each thread will increase by 1000 the data
center, but due to problems with justice, the data center methods and thread task must be checked
in such a way that all the threads have an equal chance to work on the datacenter to bring the final output to 5000
in the desired manner.
